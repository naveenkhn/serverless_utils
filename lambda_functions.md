# AWS Lambda Functions

## 1. What is AWS Lambda?

AWS Lambda is a **serverless compute service** that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. You only pay for the compute time you consume ‚Äî there is no charge when your code is not running. It's ideal for lightweight, event-driven use cases such as APIs, file processing, notifications, and more.

In this repository (`serverless_utils`), you'll find Lambda function implementations ‚Äî starting with the `pageview_counter`, and more to come.

## 2. How to Create a Lambda Function (with AWS SAM)

This project uses the **AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM)** CLI.

### üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Guide

#### a. Initialize a project
```bash
sam init
```

#### b. Build the function
```bash
sam build
```

#### c. Deploy (guided)
```bash
sam deploy --guided
```

This command will:
- Package your code and dependencies
- Upload it to S3
- Create or update CloudFormation stack
- Deploy the Lambda, API Gateway (if defined), and other resources

Once deployed, the Lambda will be live and triggered based on the defined event source (e.g., HTTP request).

## 3. How does Lambda work behind the scenes?

When a Lambda function is triggered:

1. **AWS provisions a lightweight container** (if not already warm) and loads your function code.
2. It **executes the handler method** with the event payload.
3. The Lambda **terminates or stays warm** depending on future traffic.

Under the hood:
- API Gateway ‚Üí triggers the Lambda
- IAM roles ‚Üí grant permissions to access services (e.g., DynamoDB)
- CloudWatch ‚Üí captures logs from Lambda executions
- CloudFormation ‚Üí manages all infrastructure as code

## 3.1 Performance Overhead & Limitations

### ‚è±Ô∏è Performance Overhead
- **Cold Starts**: The first request after a period of inactivity may experience a delay (typically 100ms to a few seconds) while AWS provisions a container.
- **Stateless Execution**: Lambda functions do not retain memory or local state between invocations.
- **Limited Execution Time**: Maximum duration is 15 minutes per invocation.
- **Concurrent Execution Limits**: There is an account-level limit on the number of concurrent executions (can be increased by request).

### üöß Limitations
- **Memory and Storage**:
  - Memory: 128 MB to 10 GB
  - Temporary `/tmp` storage: up to 512 MB (can be increased to 10 GB)
- **Package Size**: Deployment package (zipped) must be less than 50 MB for direct upload or 250 MB when using S3.
- **Environment Variables**: Max size is 4 KB.
- **No direct support for GPUs**: Lambda doesn‚Äôt support GPU acceleration for workloads.

Use cases with heavy compute, long-running tasks, or needing persistent connections (e.g., WebSockets or stateful apps) may not be a good fit for Lambda.

### 3.2 How does Lambda handle concurrent events?

AWS Lambda is designed for horizontal scalability. When multiple events (e.g., HTTP requests) occur simultaneously:

- **Each event triggers a separate invocation** of the Lambda function.
- Lambda can spin up multiple containers to handle these in parallel.
- AWS allows for up to **1,000 concurrent executions per region by default** (soft limit).

In the case of the `pageview_counter`:
- Each visitor to the portfolio page triggers a Lambda run.
- The counter is updated using DynamoDB's `ADD` operation, which is **atomic**.
- Even with high concurrency, **DynamoDB ensures accurate view counts** via serialized, thread-safe operations.

This ensures that spikes in traffic are handled gracefully without data corruption or missed updates.

---

## 4. Example: `pageview_counter`

This function:
- Is triggered via an HTTP GET request
- Increments a page counter stored in DynamoDB
- Returns the updated count

**Endpoint**:  
```
https://<api-id>.execute-api.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/visit/
```

### üîß Useful AWS CLI Commands

Reset views:
```bash
aws dynamodb update-item \
  --table-name pageview_counter \
  --key '{"page": {"S": "home"}}' \
  --update-expression "SET #v = :zero" \
  --expression-attribute-names '{"#v":"views"}' \
  --expression-attribute-values '{":zero": {"N": "0"}}' \
  --region ap-south-1
```

Get current views:
```bash
aws dynamodb get-item \
  --table-name pageview_counter \
  --key '{"page": {"S": "home"}}' \
  --region ap-south-1
```

## 5. Monitoring

Use CloudWatch Logs to check invocation logs:
```bash
aws logs describe-log-streams \
  --log-group-name "/aws/lambda/<function-name>" \
  --order-by LastEventTime \
  --descending \
  --limit 1
```

```bash
aws logs get-log-events \
  --log-group-name "/aws/lambda/<function-name>" \
  --log-stream-name "<latest-stream-name>"
```
